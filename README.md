# SV-integration
Runnable demos for MC-SV integration
Attached are 2 runnable demos:
There is the Lab/demo/weather-forecast demo showing the Appium-MC-virtual REST service and the Lab/demo/gadgetbridge showing the BLE simulation (without any automated test).

Each demo contains a PDF readme describing how to setup and run the demo and how the feature works.
